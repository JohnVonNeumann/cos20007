# SwinAdventure

Swin Adventure is an stage-by-stage programming problem divided into numerous "iterations" where students must
follow an implementation plan and specification in order to create a more increasingly complex program 
written in a clear OOP fashion. We are not given the code, we must write that ourselves, but what we are given
are industry style documents designed to help us write our program in a plan driven way.


### Provisos

We don't choose many of the names in the program, use of the word "Object" within Class/Object names is not something
I'd usually do, but in this situation, it's required for completion of the program.
